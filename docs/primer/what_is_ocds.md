The Open Contracting Data Standards (OCDS) is a free, non-proprietary open data standard for public contracting, implemented by over 30 governments around the world.  This page exists to:

*   Describe the different aspects of OCDS
*   Connect OCDS to the contracting process
```
“Open Contracting Data Standard” contains three concepts that are critically important: **Open Contracting, Open Data,** and **Data Standard**.

*   **Open contracting** seeks to drive better results from procurement and public contracts. These results include improving the efficiency, effectiveness and integrity of a public contracting system.
*   **Open data** is the idea that governments should publish their data so that it can be reused. This requires data to be accessible and machine-readable, and for permission to be granted for reuse.
*   **Data standards** set out how to format data so that it is machine-readable, they resolve ambiguity and help systems and people work out how to interpret data. 

OCDS builds on all three of these concepts, and the ultimate goal of OCDS is to **help deliver** open contracting using standardized open data. Academic research shows that improved openness and transparency is good for public integrity, value for money and competition when it is linked to systemic changes that allow people to use the information. [More than 50 countries and cities, from Argentina to Zambia](https://www.open-contracting.org/impact/), are pursuing open contracting reforms to make public procurement fairer and more efficient.

OCDS describes a way to model and publish data in a standardized way along entire public contracting processes, from planning through to delivery and payment.

OCDS provides an open schema for publishing structured data as a foundation for effective open contracting. OCDS can help make sure that the contracting data you publish meet global best practices and are fit-for-purpose to meet the needs of a range of different users. 

To facilitate publication of contracting data to meet a variety of needs, OCDS provides:

*   A common structured **data model**, including a schema, codelists, and rules to define standard values for several fields and contracting processes;
*   **Guidance and tools** to support implementation and data use;
*   An **extension** mechanism to add additional key information to your OCDS data; and
*   A free global **helpdesk**.
